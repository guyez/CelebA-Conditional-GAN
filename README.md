# CelebA Conditional Generation using a VAC+GAN

## Getting Started

1. Download the datatest zip file (img_align_celeba.zip) and the attribute file (list_attr_celeba.txt) from http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html
2. Create a folder in your Google Drive where upload the downloaded files
3. Open the VAC+GAN notebook and enjoy!
4. If you do not want to download the datatest zip file and the attribute file you can use the VAC+GAN+tfrec notebook. Doing so the dataset is loaded from a Google Cloud bucket. Please notice that if you want to load the datatest from tfrecords after April 2021 you have to use the celeba_tfrec script (`celeba_tfrec.py --fn_root PathWhereYourZipFileIsStored --partition_fn PathWhereYouWantToSaveTheTfrecs --number NumberOfTfrecs`) to create your own tfrec files and upload them on a Google Cloud bucket that you prefer, then you just have to modify a little bit the notebook code by changing the path of the bucket.

In this kind of approach, the Generative Adversarial Network generator is turned into a conditional generator by placing a multi-class classifier in parallel with the discriminator network and backpropagate the classification error through the generator. This technique is versatile enough to be applied to any GAN.

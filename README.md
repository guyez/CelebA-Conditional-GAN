# CelebA-Conditional-GAN
VAC+GAN for conditional generation

If you do not want to download the datatest zip file and the attribute file from http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html you can use the VAC+GAN+tfrec notebook. Doing so the dataset is loaded from a Google Cloud bucket. Please notice that it will be available on it till April 2021. If you prefer to load the datatest from tfrecords after that date you can use the celeba_tfrec script to create your tfrec files and upload them on a Google Cloud bucket that you prefer, then you have just to modify a little bit the notebook code by changing the path of the bucket.
